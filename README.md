# Card game named tapon. Single player python command line game.

My first program in python after learngin OOP and began using git. Decided to make public, update, and refactor some code after realizing how much fun I had when I needed a break.
Plan is to make a multiplayer web app.

Python version - 3.8.1

How to play:

Select table size between 2-4 to play against 1-3 CPU players.
Select player coins. Last player standing collects all coins and wins!
Each player draws card from deck and decides wether to stay or change on their turn.
You are unable to change if the player next in line holds a king(12).
You can stay and hold card if you receive a higher card from player in line before you.
Player with lower card in each round loses coin.
Dearler can draw card from deck if they choose to.
